Missing Completely At Random (MCAR)\n","* The probability of data being missing is the same for all the observations. \n","* The statistical analysis remains unbiased.\n","* e.g. Someone forgetting to type in the values.\n","2. Missing At Random (MAR)\n","* There is some relationship between the missing data and other values/data. \n","* The statistical analysis might result in bias. Getting an unbiased estimate of the parameters can be done only by modeling the missing data.\n","* e.g. Most of the females donâ€™t want to reveal their age during the survey.\n","3. Missing Not At Random (MNAR)\n","* There is some structure/pattern in missing data and other observed data can not explain it\n","* e.g. People having less income may refuse to share some information in a survey or questionnaire.\n","\n","**Why Do We Need to Care About Handling Missing Data?**\n","* Many machine learning algorithms fail if the dataset contains missing values. However, algorithms like K-nearest and Naive Bayes support data with missing values.\n","* You may end up building a biased machine learning model, leading to incorrect results if the missing values are not handled properly.\n","* Missing data can lead to a lack of precision in the statistical analysis.\n","\n","**There are 2 main methods on how to deal with missing value?**\n","1. imputation (reasonable guesses) missing data\n","* Replacing with an arbitrary value, the mean, the mode, the median or the previous/next value.\n","2. remove the missing data\n","* remove some rows and/or columns\n","\n","reference:\n","* https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/10/handling-missing-value/"],"metadata":{"id":"yOyOKdFWO_mB"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Other related information.**\n","* How to diagnose the missing data mechanism?
