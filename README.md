This is my previous repository for my data science lectures. However, I won't be updating it anymore because I've come to realize that there is so much more to learn in this field, and I want to pursue more niche projects.

When it comes to learning new things, here's my advice:
1. Focus on creating small projects.
2. Learn coding by exploring other open source projects.
3. Choose topics that are related to your interests and goals.
4. Continuously develop your initial projects into more general or specialized projects.

I have created a new repository for my data science lectures, which can be found at this link: https://github.com/NihilisticMotif/EtCetera_at_an_Exhibition. 
The content of this repository primarily focuses on common Machine Learning algorithms and other common statstical techniques, e.g. Linear Regression, Probability Distribution, SVD etc.

Also, thanked ChatGPT for improving my English language writing.
