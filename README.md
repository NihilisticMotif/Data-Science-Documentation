This is my previous repository about my data science lecture. 

I won't update anything new here because I realize that there is too many thing to learn in this field
and I want to do more niche project (especially about computer vision, image processing and AI Art).

Also, my advice on learning new thing is to focus on 
1. creating small project
2. learn coding from other open source project
3. and choosing the related topics to learn.
4. constantly develop this initial project in to more general purpose and/or more specialize purpose project.
