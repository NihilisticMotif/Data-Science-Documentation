This is my previous repository for my data science lectures. However, I won't be updating it anymore because I've come to realize that there is so much more to learn in this field, and I want to pursue more niche projects.

When it comes to learning new things, here's my advice:
1. Focus on creating small projects.
2. Learn coding by exploring other open source projects.
3. Choose topics that are related to your interests and goals.
4. Continuously develop your initial projects into more general or specialized projects.

I have created a new repository for my data science lectures, which can be found at this link: https://github.com/NihilisticMotif/EtCetera_at_an_Exhibition. 
The content of this repository primarily focuses on computer vision, image processing, and AI Art. 
However, there are also some lectures that are not directly related to this field, such as Linear Regression, Normal Distribution etc. 
I included them because I find them interesting, and it's often helpful to learn simpler versions of concepts before diving into more complex ones.
